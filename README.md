# Regression Modeling with R
Materials for Regression Modeling With R Workshop. http://tiny.ucsf.edu/dsiregr

Workshop Overview
 
This is a 2-part hands-on workshop that covers how to build common regression models using the R programming language, and how to visualize the results. It is not an introductory R programming workshop. See prerequisities below.
 
Learning Objectives
 
In Part 1 of this workshop, participants will:

    Learn how to build regression models for:
        continuous outcomes
        binary outcomes
    Learn how to visually check assumptions and summarize regression results


In Part 2 of this workshop, participants will:

    Learn how to build regression models for:
        survival outcomes
    Learn how to visually check assumptions and summarize regression results

 
Prerequisites
 
Intermediate R programming skills, such as how to install packages, load data into R, perform summary statistics, and basic plots (ideally with ggplot2). Please also have the software installed prior to the workshop (see below).
 
Software
